# AI-Driven Traffic Flow Prediction System ðŸš—

## Overview

The AI-Driven Traffic Flow Prediction System is an advanced traffic management solution that uses machine learning to predict traffic flow patterns and recommend optimal routes. Built with Python and Flask, this system helps users navigate through traffic by providing real-time predictions and alternative route suggestions based on historical traffic data and current conditions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (optional)
- Git

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone your repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoAftaab/AI-Driven-Traffic-Flow-Prediction.git
cd Traffic-Flow-Prediction-System
```

2. Build and run with Docker:
```bash
docker build -t traffic-flow-prediction .
docker run -p 5000:5000 traffic-flow-prediction
```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoAftaab/AI-Driven-Traffic-Flow-Prediction-.git
cd Traffic-Flow-Prediction-System
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r visualization_requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. **Predict Traffic Flow**
   - Enter a SCATS point number
   - Select the prediction model (LSTM/GRU/RNN)
   - View the predicted traffic flow

2. **Generate Routes**
   - Enter source and destination SCATS points
   - Enable/disable traffic incident simulation
   - View multiple route options with ETAs


3. **View Visualizations**
   - Click "View Routes" to see the route map
   - Check traffic incident impacts
   - Analyze traffic patterns

## ðŸš¦ Traffic Incident Simulation
**Purpose**: Simulates traffic incidents to analyze their impact on traffic flow and route planning.

**How to Enable**:
On the main page, check the **"Enable Traffic Incident Simulation"** checkbox before generating routes.  
The application will display active incidents and their effects on the suggested routes.

**Functionality**:
- Randomly generates traffic incidents that can affect the predicted traffic flow.  
- Provides users with updated route suggestions based on current traffic conditions and incidents.
